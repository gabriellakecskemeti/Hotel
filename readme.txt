For this application you need a MySQL server.

1. Start MySQL Server
   The application supposes, that you have the user = "root" and password=""
   If you use xampp you have to start Apache too if you want to use phpmyadmin.

2. Generation of the Database
   You have to generate the database and some test data.
   For this I created Hotel.sql
   
   I suggest to use phpmyAdmin. You can start it with following link:
   http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin/index.php?reload=1

   You can import it in phpmyadmin using the import function.

If the sql server is running and you imported the database in phpmyadmin,
you can start the application in cmd:
java -jar Hotel.jar

Username: test
Password: test
